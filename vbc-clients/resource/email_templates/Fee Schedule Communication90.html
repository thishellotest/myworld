<p><strong>Hi {first_name}:</strong></p>
<p>Current: {current_rating}% evaluation: ${current_evaluation}/month</p>
<p><strong>Outcome Estimates:</strong><br/>
<ul>
    <li>90% evaluation: $2,241/month ($26,892/year, $268,920/10 years, $537,840/20 years)</li>
    <li>100% evaluation: $3,737/month ($44,844/year, $448,440/10 years, $896,880/20 years)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><strong>Included with the 100% evaluation:</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Full waiver of property taxes in states like Florida and Texas</li>
    <li>An additional $1,600 monthly death benefit (DIC) to your spouse</li>
    <li>Up to $1,500 monthly education benefit for dependent children aged 18-26 or a spouse</li>
    <li>Potential qualification for a disabled veteran license plate, a handicap placard, waived registration fees for the primary vehicle, and federal student loan forgiveness</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><strong>VBC Fee Schedule:</strong>
<ul>
    <li>90% evaluation: $8,000 (Payable only upon receiving a 90% evaluation)</li>
    <li>100% evaluation: $13,000 (Payable only upon receiving a 100% evaluation)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The maximum amount owed is tied to the 100% evaluation. Should the veteran's initial increase be augmented later, you'll only owe the difference between the increased rating and what's already been settled.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Assessing the necessary exams and opinions</li>
    <li>Providing a network of independent medical experts for private consultations (optional)</li>
    <li>Identifying the appropriate application forms</li>
    <li>Ensuring comprehensive review of paperwork before VA submission</li>
    <li>Guaranteeing prompt processing of claims post submission to VA</li>
</ul>
</p>

    <strong>Who We Are:</strong> We are a committed team of veterans, driven by the mission to guide our comrades through the VA process efficiently. Numerous entities offer aid to veterans, but we're dedicated to delivering unparalleled service in significantly less time and at competitive costs. In order to uphold our mission, we kindly request payment within 7 days of a positive decision.
    Note: The back pay you'll receive typically offsets our fee. Keep in mind that these projections are based on a single veteran with no dependents. If you have dependents, your monthly allowance will increase; however, our fees remain consistent.
