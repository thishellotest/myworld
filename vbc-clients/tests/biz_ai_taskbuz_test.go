After graduating in October, I stayed at Lackland for the Security Forces Apprentice Course, which I completed in January 2012. Those first months were intense - learning law enforcement procedures, weapons handling, combat tactics, and the mental discipline required for the job.\\nAs a 3P051 Security Forces member, I was the Air Force's first line of defense. My job was to maintain the rule of law on all Air Force bases and installations, handling all police activities associated with an Air Force base. This meant I was essentially military police with additional combat and security responsibilities.\\nDaily Routine and Physical Demands\\nThe physical demands started with the schedule itself. We typically worked one of three shift patterns: either 8-hour shifts that often stretched to 10 hours with arming up and de-arming before and after shift, 12-hour shifts that could extend to 14 hours, or a rotating schedule of \\\"two day shifts, two swing shifts, two mid shifts, and four days off.\\\" These irregular hours meant my body never fully adjusted to any sleep pattern.\\nDuring duty, I encountered \\\"significant physical stressors, including protracted duty days, shift-work schedules, prolonged standing, environmental exposures, and heavy loads from gear and weapons.\\\" On a typical day, I'd stand post for hours wearing 30+ pounds of gear including body armor, weapon, ammunition, and other equipment regardless of weather conditions. The physical toll was constant - back pain became my companion from working those long shifts in full gear.\\nWhen patrolling the base perimeter, I'd walk miles daily while remaining hypervigilant. Entry control point duty meant standing for extended periods, checking IDs and inspecting vehicles. During exercises and real-world responses, I'd run with all my gear to reach incident locations quickly. The constant physical readiness requirements meant regular physical training was mandatory to maintain the strength and endurance needed for the job.\\nMental Demands and Stressors\\nThe mental aspects were equally challenging. The job came with \\\"a lot of pressure\\\" and could cause \\\"mental and physical stress.\\\" As Security Forces, I was responsible for protecting assets, defending air bases, and potentially using deadly force. This enormous responsibility weighed on me every day.\\nThe constant vigilance required was mentally exhausting. I was tasked with \\\"keeping the people, planes, base, weapons, and the surrounding area safe from any threat.\\\" Every shift, I had to remain alert for hours, watching for anything suspicious while dealing with routine tasks. This hypervigilance, necessary for the job, created a persistent state of stress.\\nThe long shifts contributed to \\\"mental fatigue\\\" and sometimes created \\\"strains on marriage or personal life.\\\" After completing ALS (Airman Leadership School) in 2016, I gained additional supervisory responsibilities that added another layer of mental pressure, as I was now responsible for the performance and well-being of junior Airmen.\\nDeployment Experience in Afghanistan\\nMy deployment to Afghanistan was the most intense period of my service. Having completed Evasion Conduct After Capture training in 2015 prepared me mentally, but nothing fully prepares you for the reality of a combat zone.\\nWar exposure significantly increased \\\"risk of exposure to trauma, which in turn, predicted elevated PTS symptoms and resource loss.\\\"  The threat of attack was constant. I experienced the stress of convoy operations, checking for IEDs, manning entry control points, and responding to security threats - all while knowing that any routine duty could turn deadly in seconds.\\nMy combat deployment earned me the Afghanistan Campaign Medal with 1 Service Star, but it came with a cost. The constant threat awareness created a hypervigilance that followed me home. Studies found that about 13.5% of military personnel deployed to Afghanistan developed deployment-related mental disorders, with PTSD being the most common diagnosis. \\nAnxiety-Inducing Aspects\\nSeveral aspects of the job specifically triggered anxiety:\\nLife-or-death decisions: Being authorized to use deadly force meant potentially having to make split-second decisions that could end a life or save many. This responsibility was always in the back of my mind.\\nUnpredictable incidents: Never knowing when an alarm would sound or an incident would occur kept me in a state of readiness that was difficult to turn off.\\nShift work disruption: The 24-hour career nature meant \\\"shift work consisting of Days, Afternoons, and Midnights\\\" which disrupted sleep patterns and created chronic fatigue. This impacted my ability to manage stress effectively.\\nLeadership dynamics: Dealing with \\\"constant policy changes\\\" and shifts that sometimes had \\\"no clear direction\\\" added organizational stress to an already demanding job. \\nDeployment uncertainty: Never knowing when I'd be deployed again or what conditions I'd face created background anxiety that affected long-term planning.\\n\\nAfter completing Airman Leadership School in 2016, I took on trainer responsibilities using my Air Force Trainer Course certification from 2014. This added the stress of being responsible for others' performance and readiness, knowing their lives might depend on how well I trained them.\\nDespite the challenges, earning the AF Outstanding Unit Award, AF Organizational Excellence Award, AF Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Afghanistan Campaign Medal with 1 Service Star, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, and Air Force Expeditionary Service Ribbon with Gold Border reflected my dedication to the mission and ability to perform under these demanding conditions.\\nThe experience shaped me into someone who can handle extreme pressure, remain vigilant in chaotic situations, and lead others through challenging circumstances - but it came with physical and mental costs that I still manage today.\",\"name\":\"whatWere\",\"order\":\"14\",\"text\":\"What were some challenges you had to overcome during your time in service?\",\"type\":\"control_textarea\"},{\"name\":\"additionalComments\",\"order\":\"15\",\"text\":\"Additional comments:\",\"type\":\"control_textarea\"},{\"name\":\"submit2\",\"order\":\"16\",\"text\":\"Submit\",\"type\":\"control_button\"}]"}]},{"role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"text","text":"# VETERAN SUMMARY\n\nâ¢ Full Name: Evan Wagner\nâ¢ Unique ID: 5547\nâ¢ Branch of Service: Air Force\nâ¢ Years of Service: 2011-2017\nâ¢ Retirement status: Did not retire from service\nâ¢ Deployments: Afghanistan in 2015\nâ¢ Marital Status: Married since 2014\nâ¢ Children: 2 young children\nâ¢ Occupation in service: 3PO51/Security Forces\n\nTo proceed with creating VA disability personal statements, I'll need specific information about which medical conditions you're seeking VA benefits for.

While there and near the end of our deployment, two of my fellow Airmen were on a C-130, call sign TORGE 62, returning to Bagram AB from Jalalabad Airfield, providing security when the plane went down.\\n\\nI was sleeping in my bunk when leadership came to our barracks and woke us up.  We form up around the table in the main area of the barracks with the other members of our unit.  We had about 100 Airmen in our unit so we all knew each other.  Once we were all assembled, leadership briefed us on the details of the plane crash and loss of everyone on board including our fellow Security Forces members.  The C-130 crashed 28 seconds after take off killing all 11 members on board, and 3 on the ground. \\n\\nThe mood was very somber, everyone was in disbelief, and I had a sense of guilt.  I felt it guilt that it could have or should have been me.  \\n\\nAirman 1st Class Kcey Ruiz was one of the Airman on the C-130 and killed in the crash.  She and I had worked closely together at Hanscom Air Force Base, MA. for at least a year before the deployment.  We stood Gate Entry duty, patrol, she would hang out with me when I was working dispatch.  We got to know each other well and became friends. \\n\\nSenior Airman Nathan Sartain was another one of the Airman on the C-130 that was killed in the crash.  He and I knew each other from SEER and other Security training before deployment. He was from Florida like me, and I remember he was a funny guy.  I would see and talk to him in passing when we were deployed.\\n\\nHearing of their death in this way and so close to returning home was very difficult to deal with.  On our return from the deployment we stopped in Germany for Deployment Assistance Transition before returning home to Hanscom AB.\\n\\nWhen I retuned to Hanscom AB and worked the same Gate and duty I shared with Kcey Ruiz it was upsetting.  Nathan Sartain usually worked opposite shifts and would come relieve Ruiz and I.

AVOID These Prohibited Elements\nâ¢ No specific degree measurements\n- Never include numbers followed by the degree symbol (Â°) or the word \"degrees\"\n- Example prohibited: \"30 degrees\" or \"30Â°\" or \"fifteen degrees\"\n- Never include any numeric measurements related to movement\nâ¢ No medical terminology\n- Never use terms like: flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, pronation, supination, dorsiflexion, plantar flexion, lateral rotation, medial rotation\n- Never use clinical/medical terms that describe movement\n- Example prohibited: \"forward flexion,\" \"lateral flexion,\" \"dorsiflexion\"\nâ¢ No clinical language\n- Never use overly clinical descriptions of symptoms or limitations\n- Example prohibited: \"decreased range of motion in the sagittal plane\"\n2. PROPER FORMAT for Describing Limitations\nAlways structure descriptions to include:\n1.General statement about limitation\n- \"My range of motion is severely limited.\"\n2.Normal daily condition (in plain language)\n- \"I can bend my knee slightly, but with significant pain.\"\n3.Flare-up condition (also in plain language)\n- \"During flare-ups, I cannot bend my knee at all.\"\n4.Impact on specific daily activities\n- \"This makes climbing stairs, getting in and out of cars, and playing with my children extremely difficult.\"\n3. USE These Approved Everyday Phrases\nInstead of specific measurements, use phrases like:\nâ¢ \"Can barely bend\"\nâ¢ \"Very limited movement\"\nâ¢ \"During flare-ups, I can hardly move at all\"\nâ¢ \"Extremely challenging to straighten\"\nâ¢ \"Minimal movement possible\"\nInstead of medical terminology, use everyday language:\nâ¢ \"Bending forward/backward\" (not flexion/extension)\nâ¢ \"Straightening my arm/leg\" (not extension)\nâ¢ \"Moving my arm away from my body\" (not abduction)\nâ¢ \"Crossing my legs\" (not adduction)\nâ¢ \"Pointing my toes up/down\" (not dorsiflexion/plantar flexion)\nâ¢ \"Twisting my body/limb\" (not rotation)\n4. ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS to Include\nâ¢ Always mention \"worsening in frequency and severity\" if stated in form\nâ¢ DO mention \"range of motion\" but NEVER use numbers\nâ¢ Clearly distinguish between normal limitations and flare-up limitations\nâ¢ Describe how limitations impact specific daily activities\nâ¢ Mention any assistive devices used\nâ¢ Discuss impact on work and family relationships\nâ¢ Express pain levels in relation to activities, not on numeric scales\n5. EXAMPLES of Compliant Descriptions\nCOMPLIANT: \"I have very limited ability to point my foot upward, and can only move it downward slightly. During flare-ups, I can barely move my foot in either direction. This makes walking, driving, and climbing stairs extremely difficult.\"\nCOMPLIANT: \"I can only bend forward slightly, and during flare-ups, I can barely move at all. This makes simple tasks like picking up objects from the floor or tying my shoes extremely challenging. At work, I need to ask colleagues for help whenever something falls on the floor.\"\nCOMPLIANT: \"The movement in my shoulder is extremely limited. On normal days, I struggle to lift my arm above shoulder height, which makes everyday tasks like putting dishes in cabinets or washing my hair very painful. During flare-ups, I can barely move my arm at all and need my spouse's assistance for basic personal care.\"\n6. RANGE OF MOTION FORMAT REQUIREMENTS\nâ¢ Always create a separate paragraph specifically for describing range of motion limitations\nâ¢ Make the range of motion description clear and distinct from other symptom descriptions\nâ¢ Begin the paragraph with \"My range of motion is severely limited\" or similar phrase\nâ¢ Completely avoid any numerical measurements, percentages, or angles when describing movement\nâ¢ Use comparative language instead (e.g., \"slightly\", \"barely\", \"hardly at all\")\nâ¢ Clearly contrast normal day limitations with flare-up limitations\nâ¢ EXAMPLE OF CORRECT RANGE OF MOTION PARAGRAPH:\n\"My range of motion is severely limited. On normal days, I can barely bend my knee when trying to squat, making it difficult to pick things up from the floor. During flare-ups, which happen several times a month, I cannot bend my knee at all without excruciating pain. Similarly, straightening my leg is very restricted on regular days, and during flare-ups, this movement is almost impossible. These severe limitations affect virtually every movement I make throughout the day.\"\nGUIDELINES FOR MENTAL HEALTH STATEMENTS\nWhen creating personal statements for mental health conditions, follow these specific guidelines:\n1. LENGTH AND DETAIL:\nâ¢ Mental health statements should be more detailed than other condition statements\nâ¢ Include at least 2-3 paragraphs for each section (Current Symptoms, Impact on Daily Life, Professional Impact)\nâ¢ Use the veteran's EXACT WORDS from the form whenever possible\nâ¢ Do not paraphrase or summarize the veteran's experience\n2. REQUIRED CONTENT:\nâ¢ Provide clear background of any traumatic events or experiences that led to mental health issues\nâ¢ Include specific incidents if mentioned in the form\nâ¢ Describe onset clearly - when and what caused the condition\nâ¢ If physical conditions contribute to mental health, explain this connection in detail\nâ¢ Detail occupational and social impairment using examples from the form\nâ¢ Include all symptoms mentioned in the form, organized logically\nâ¢ Describe frequency and severity of each symptom\nâ¢ Include impacts on:\n- Mood (depression, anxiety, panic, etc.)\n- Cognitive function (memory, concentration, decision-making)\n- Social function (avoidance, isolation, relationship impacts)\n- Sleep (nightmares, insomnia, quality issues)\n- Self-care and daily functioning\n- Work performance and capabilities\n3. EXAMPLE OF PROPER DETAIL LEVEL:\nCurrent Symptoms, Severity and Frequency:\nSince first experiencing this condition during service, my PTSD has worsened in both frequency and severity. I have persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and lack of interest in activities I once enjoyed. I experience weight fluctuations, sleep disturbances, fatigue, and difficulty concentrating. I avoid going out and socializing. I even have difficulty spending time with family and try to avoid them.\nActivities I used to enjoy feel less engaging. I find it hard to relax in public spaces. I get uncomfortable when people walk behind me. I get sudden panic attacks in crowded stores. I experience difficulty focusing on conversations or media for more than a few minutes. I do not get a lot of sleep per night. I lose track of conversations mid-sentence and have difficulty remembering what I did yesterday. People say I rarely smile anymore. I stutter more when I'm stressed.\nI can't follow group conversations as easily as before. I struggle to make simple decisions. I take things more literally than I used to. My thoughts often jump around randomly. I have difficulty finding the energy to start simple tasks. Small talk feels more challenging than before. Stress often makes me withdraw completely. I think about not being here sometimes. I count steps, items, or movements frequently. I occasionally snap at people without warning. I sometimes hear my name being called when no one is there. I occasionally talk to myself in public. I have trouble sticking to a regular schedule. I frequently lose track of what day it is.\nFOR SPECIFIC CONDITION TYPES:\nFor Sleep Apnea Statements:\nâ¢ Use layman's terms to describe symptoms\nâ¢ Avoid discussing medical test results or jargon\nâ¢ Explain how it affects daily functioning and work performance\nFor PTSD Statements:\nâ¢ Provide vivid background of traumatic events\nâ¢ Include specific traumatic incidents with emotional impact\nâ¢ Describe how symptoms affect daily functioning\nFor Headache Statements:\nâ¢ Include specific frequency (days per month)\nâ¢ Use terms like \"prostrating\" if appropriate\nâ¢ Describe impact on work and daily activities\n"}`
