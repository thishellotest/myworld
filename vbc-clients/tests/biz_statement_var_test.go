var StatementStringVar = `# Name of Disability/Condition: Erectile Dysfunction
Current Treatment Facility: Not provided
Current Medication: None listed

SERVICE CONNECTION: My service treatment records reflect that I suffered from Erectile Dysfunction while on active duty. All legal requirements for establishing service connection for Erectile Dysfunction have been met; service connection for such disease is warranted.

I am respectfully requesting Veteran Affairs benefits for my condition of Erectile Dysfunction which began during my service. I served in the United States Air Force from 2018 to 2025 as a Security Forces member (3P071). During this service period, I developed Erectile Dysfunction that continues to affect my daily life and ability to work.

## Onset and Service Connection:

My Erectile Dysfunction began in 2024 while I was stationed with the 88th Security Forces at Wright Patterson AFB, Ohio. For approximately a year, I started having difficulty maintaining an erection during sexual intercourse with my wife. Despite initial arousal, I would quickly lose my erection, leaving both of us frustrated and disconnected. Prior to joining the military, I never had issues maintaining an erection. My symptoms developed and worsened throughout my military career.

The high-stress environment of military service, specifically the constant readiness requirements and pressure to perform perfectly as a Security Forces member, created overwhelming mental exhaustion. This intensive operational environment took a significant toll on my mental and physical health. The constant vigilance required in my role, combined with irregular shift patterns and sleep disruption, created chronic stress that manifested in erectile dysfunction.

## Current Symptoms, Severity and Frequency:

My erectile dysfunction symptoms have worsened significantly over time. Currently, I experience consistent difficulty achieving and maintaining an erection sufficient for sexual intercourse. Despite feeling desire and initial arousal, I quickly lose my erection before completion of sexual activity. This happens nearly every time my wife and I attempt intimacy.

The severity has progressed to the point where successful intercourse has become rare, creating significant strain on my marriage. The psychological impact compounds the physical symptoms, as each unsuccessful attempt increases performance anxiety for future encounters. The condition has become more persistent and pronounced during periods of heightened stress, particularly as I've been transitioning out of military service.

## Medication:

I am not currently taking any medications for my erectile dysfunction. I have not sought treatment previously due to embarrassment about discussing these issues with medical providers. I was uncomfortable talking about what was happening with my body and my inability to maintain an erection. I most recently saw a doctor regarding this issue on March 26, 2025.

## Impact on Daily Life:

My erectile dysfunction has significantly affected my personal life, particularly my marriage. My wife and I argue more frequently due to the strain this condition has placed on our intimate relationship. Even when we try to connect emotionally, I can't stay present; my thoughts are consumed by anxiety about my sexual performance.

The condition has created significant challenges with intimacy in our relationship. What should be moments of connection have become sources of frustration and disappointment. This has led to emotional withdrawal from intimacy altogether, as the fear of failure often prevents me from initiating or responding to my wife's advances.

Beyond our intimate relationship, the condition causes emotional stress that affects my overall well-being. I experience anxiety about fertility and sexual function that affects my sleep quality. I often lie awake worrying about my condition and its impact on our marriage and future family planning.

## Professional Impact:

The emotional stress from my erectile dysfunction affects my job performance and interactions with others. My concentration at work suffers as I'm frequently distracted by worries about my condition and its impact on my marriage. The sleep disturbances caused by anxiety over my sexual function leave me fatigued during work hours, reducing my effectiveness.

During my military service, this condition added another layer of stress to an already demanding job. The private nature of the condition meant I was dealing with this struggle silently while maintaining the appearance of readiness and capability required in my Security Forces role.

In professional settings, the psychological burden of this condition sometimes manifests as irritability or withdrawal during team interactions, potentially limiting my career growth and effectiveness as a team member.

## Nexus Between Service and Current Condition:

The onset of my erectile dysfunction directly correlates with the high-stress environment of my military service. As a Security Forces member, I was subjected to constant vigilance requirements, irregular shift work including 12-hour rotations between day and night shifts, and the responsibility of protecting high-value assets where there was absolutely no room for error.

The physical demands of the job – including carrying 30+ pounds of gear during patrols in various weather conditions – combined with the mental strain of maintaining constant alertness created chronic stress. This operational tempo intensified during my time at the 88th Security Forces Squadron, where the direct connection between my duty conditions and the onset of erectile dysfunction can be clearly established.

My condition worsened due to service-related stressors including preparation for leaving military service, relocating back to the United States from overseas posting, and the uncertainty of civilian employment. These military transition processes directly exacerbated my symptoms as documented in my service treatment records.

## Request:

I respectfully request your thorough consideration of my application for benefits to help me access the necessary medical care, treatments, and resources to effectively manage my condition. Your support and understanding are crucial as I strive to regain a sense of normalcy, improve my overall well-being, and rebuild my ability to participate fully in both my personal and professional life.`
